# Bicycle Advert Scraper
A repo for sharing the code for scraping adverts of second hand bicycles

The [folder](https://github.com/j-jayes/bicycle_advert_scraper/tree/main/data/ads) shows data that is automatically scraped daily with Github actions. 

If you want the data, clone the repo or [download the zipped repo](https://github.com/j-jayes/bicycle_advert_scraper/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

The scraping code is commented and should be clear. Shoot me a message at j0nathanjayes@gmail.com with any clarifying questions.
