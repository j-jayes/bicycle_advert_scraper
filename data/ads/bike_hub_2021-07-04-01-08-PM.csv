The geometry and travel on the 6061 aluminium frame are designed for speed on the trails. Fly faster around trails and conquer singletrack with a fast, responsive frame. The list of components on this bike are also as competitive as the price, featuring 100mm Fox Evolution forks, hydraulic Shimano Deorre disc brakes, Shimano XT rear components. First the 6061 aluminium frame at the heart of this bike is both lightweight and responsive. With a light frame, and a short travel rear suspension unit, this bike will keep you firmly planted on technical trails and allow you to corner faster and beat your friends out of the woods. The Shimano gearing which features an XT rear mech and various Deore components offers a powerful balance of responsive shifting performance and long term durability. The XT rear mech will shift effortlessly even under strain and the 10 speed rear mech will provide enough gears for any hill or long day of riding. The gearing on this bike is also designed for long term durability and quality. The 100mm Fox Float forks will help to keep your front end planted on the trail. With a responsive rebound, these forks will keep up easily with bumpy terrain and provide you with a more planted, controlled and comfortable ride. Shimano M506 hydraulic disc brakes provide great stopping power so you will be able to ride faster and more confidently into corners and down steep descents knowing that you will be able to stop quickly when required. This is particularly beneficial in tight, technical situations where you have changing terrains and gradients. Finally this bike features 27.5"" wheels. This wheel size provides the best of both worlds when it comes to off-road riding. Featuring the efficiency and performance of a larger wheel for cross country riding and nimble agility of a smaller wheel for tight, technical trails.

That’s a dangerous game to play in an innovation-led industry, but in the case of the Trance X4 there was nothing much to improve on an already near-perfect bike. It is the best-performing suspension bike you can buy for (the price), but we’d go further than that and say it beats bikes costing twice its price. It is, quite simply, a steal and now even better value than last year after its price drop.

This was the first Tarmac, and, rumour has it, cost Specialized more to make than to sell. The frame is aluminium (bottom) and carbon (top) fused together to make one of the stiffest frames I have ever ridden on. This bike has history. Jamie Ball rode to third place in the Cape Town Cycle Tour (Argus) on it back in 2005, and I bought it from him. A friend has told me to keep it and put it up on the wall as he believes it's a museum-quality classic. I love just looking at it. It's a beauty of a thing. Robin Williams, the great comedian and actor, had one in his collection and it was sold at auction for a charity earlier this year. The frame has scratches and nicks, but is sound. The groupset has been upgraded to Dura Ace 7900 from the 7800 it came with. I'm selling it because I am simply not riding it, and it feels like a waste. It would be a great racing bike for a smaller person or for a collector. It weighs a shade over 7kg. The price is negotiable.

It is a great option to get back into cycling or start your cycling journey if you don’t want to spend too much yet. Especially with the Cape Town Cycle Tour around the corner! Happy to throw in a good as new Selle Italia saddle that is not a good fit for me. It's a get on and go bike - I might just need to throw in some new rim brake pads if you don't have a set. Slightly negotiable on the price but looking for a buyer who understands the bike has value and will not come with ridiculous offers. I have spent below as assurance: Brand new bottom bracket (R800) Build up done to inspect parts + Full service done (R1650) 9 Speed Drive-train more than 50% life left in it. —— More about the bicycle: This limited-edition originally came out as a performance spec bicycle with Dura-Ace components. It is one of the few bicycle ranges from Schwinn that was still made in small factories producing some of the best frames in the US. Good to know since the public perception of the brand went downhill at that time when it was bought over by a mass wholesale brand. The bike was built up again as an alternative ride for some weekend trips where I didn’t want to use my racing bike. So only light riding is done on it. Hopefully, the photos communicate this clearly, but the bicycle has been well taken care of with top to bottom approval from Specialized that all is in good working order.Info box: Frame & Fork Aluminum Frame & Reynolds Carbon Fork Front Derailleur Shimano Tiagra Rear Derailleur Shimano 105 Shifters Shimano Tiagra Crankset Truvativ Brakes Shimano 105 Wheels Ritchey Tyres Continental Gatorskin 23mm Stem Alero Saddle Profile Design / Selle Italia Pedals None",10,"NA for bikehub",NA,"EanBarnard Message Seller Location Western Cape, Stellenbosch ","Western Cape, Stellenbosch ",NA,2,1,"2021-07-04 12:59:42","Western Cape","road bikes"
