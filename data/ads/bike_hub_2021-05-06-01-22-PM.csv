This is a slightly better spec than a new 2021 Scott Spark 930 which cost like R75 000 and is built with the same frame and fork and lower spec parts). 130mm Front Fox 34 Fork with Grip damper (rebound and low speed compression adjust to lock-out) 120mm Fox DPS Rear Shock (with Scott Nude remote setup of 120mm - 85mm - lockout) The Spark Gen2 carbon frames are all the same 2017-2021 - 930, 920, 910 and 900. These all share the same frame with a carbon front and alu rear triangle and Fox DPS shock. I bought this frame last year and built it up as a ""downcountry"" bike for longer days out in the saddle, but still fun on the downs. The Spark has modern geometry and fit to ensure confident handling and comfort. It's light weight and efficient suspension means it goes up, down and around with ease. Whether you want to do stage racing like Sani 2 C or just hammer around your local trails, it'll do it all. Frame and shock were serviced at the end of 2020 by Stoke suspension and hardly ridden since then. It's for sale due to lack of use and everything is in mint condition, either new or serviced and rebuilt for this sale. It's all working well with no nonsense. New parts as listed below: New chain so the drivetrain is gonna last and last. New brakes with new pads and new rotors, totally unused New roval wheels New dropper New cockpit The Fox suspension smooths out the trail and with the remote lockout you can hammer those sprints. The 150mm dropper post lets you get in the right position for climbs and descents without compromise. The modern Shimano SLX/XT 1x12 drivetrain is up to date and delivers superb performance with seamless shifts under power and doesn't drop chains. I also have a Lyne Holy Rail double water-bottle holder for the main triangle so you can have two bottles for those longer days out (see last pic) Whatsapp for quickest responseInfo box: Frame Scott Spark 930 Carbon Size Large (Gen2 Spark same as 900-910-920-930) with 120mm travel Fork Fox 34 130mm (44mm offset, Grip damper rebound and low speed compression adjust to lock-out) Rear Shock Fox DPS Nude 3 position with remote lockout - 120mm, 85mm and locked out Front Derailleur none Rear Derailleur Shimano 1x12spd SLX M7100 Shifters Shimano 1x12spd SLX M7100 Crankset SRAM GX with C-Sixx 32t DM chainring Cassette Shimano 1x12spd XT M8100 (saves weight over the SLX cassette) Chain NEW Shimano 1x12spd SLX M7100 Brakes NEW Shimano Deore M6100 Calipers and M4100 lever with new pads and rotors as well Wheels NEW Roval alu wheels Tyres Vittoria Saguaro - Almost new, still has the rubber knobblies on them Stem Lyne AMP 50mm Handlebar NEW Lyne AMP 780mm Seatpost NEW Bontrager Line Elite 150mm with Lyne under bar lever Saddle Specialized Henge Pedals None",9,"NA for bikehub",NA,"Kaggel (9 Reviews) Message Seller Phone Number Buy with Bike Hub Pay Buy With Confidence Buyer Protection via Bike Hub Pay has you covered.

Although the Scultura 400 is a great all-round road option, the Scultura frame platform is favoured by Team Lampre Merida in the UCI Pro Tour, meaning models throughout the series benefit from the research and technological innovation that goes into building a bike to perform at the highest level. A tapered head tube provides more strength and stiffness through the front end of the bike, which means improved overall handling. Flex Stay technology in the rear allows the frame to offer some vertical movement, which is designed to absorb bumps and vibrations to create a more comfortable ride.

On the descents the Capra will change the way you process trails, everything becomes a feature, you have more fun and the speed this bike generates is only ever matched by the confidence it instils the harder you push it.

This is a once off opportunity to get a Azub Mini recumbent at a price you can never beat. For a person 154 - 188 cm is a very comfortable fit as long as you weigh less than 125 Kg with the luggage! The recumbent is the ultimate long distance touring or commuter bike. Not many bikes come standard with this amount of carrier space that the Azub offers. With wind resistance less than 30% of the conventional bike and the most relaxed sitting position for your rear and back proves the fact that this is a bike that rides very easy. No need for special clothing. That is one of the reasons this bike is so popular in Europe to commute to work with. Easy riding low wind resistance. I imported this bike since I fractured my wrist many years ago and could no longer carry any weight on my one wrist. Since ordering and importing the bike I had an operation and can now ride our trusted tandem again, hence the reason I sell this bike. I have only ridden it about 200 Km since I got it, so it is almost brand new. This bike is available for immediate collection. No need to wait for the build, importing from Europe paying vat and import duties and clearing at customs and excise. This ia a major saving! Information about the Azub Mini: Stability of the Mini model is given by its long wheelbase. It is very compact and manoeuvrable thanks to its two 20"" wheels. Seat height, which is located lower than the bottom bracket, makes it an active bike with good power transmission. This becomes obvious in a rapid ride through the city as well as during a sportier ride around. If you do not have excessive demands, your Mini will carry you with no significant problems on gravel or forest roads Properties of Azub Mini: incredibly fast in accelerating perfect manoeuvrability both 20"" wheels super compact size stiff and durable aluminium frame List of components as per order from the manufacturers in Czech Republic: find the mini (20"" wheels) AZUB Mini, orange, USS, DD27+tripple, White Brothers, Epicon, MT2, Ventisit AZUB MINI frame set Under steering AZUB (USS) 20"" Front suspension fork WHITE BROTHERS RC 80 1 1/8"" Head set AHEAD semi-integrated 28,6, cartridge H-146 Rear suspension SUNTOUR EPICON LOD (LockOut) 165mm Shifting set Dual Drive 27 PRO 20"" Shifter Dual Drive LEFT Shifter DualDrive 9-speed, trigger, right Brake set - disc.hydr. - MAGURA MT2 Front wheel 20"", Novatec DISK hub, Grand Hill rim Rear wheel 20"" Dual Drive 24/27, Grand Hill rim Pneu + tubes 20/20 1,5"" Schwalbe Marathon Seat pad Ventisit Comfort M (28x91) Carrier AZUB ALU MINI + Expedition carrier Stand ALU There are many many videos on YouTube on recumbents.

This frameset has done a total of 660km's according to my Strava stats. It was built as a Single Speed and has hardly been used in the last few years bar the odd commute. There are a few nicks on the frameset, noticeably on the head tube. SS World Champs 2012 number boards were steel plates and I fastened it to my brake hoses instead of my handlebars. Fork is a Salsa CroMoto Steel fork. The drivetrain has done a total of 50km's. (Shimano SLX 11-42, SRAM chain, SRAM Eagle 38T chain ring) I did a short ride just to make sure everything is in order. Juin Tech brakes are new (or 50km's from new). They are sealed Hydraulic units actuated via cable. Compared to my Avid BB-7's they are far superior. Don't expect full hydraulic brake performance though. I have not ridden full hydraulic brakes (SRAM Rival, Force) so I cannot really compare it to such brakes. With the 38T chain ring the chain line is not perfect - it is more biased towards the higher gears because of the 11-42 cassette. There is no issue shifting into the granny gear though. I have the direct mount spider which I will include in the sale. The SRAM Rival shifters are 2X11 and can thus be run in a 2X setup if you so wish. Wheelset is Stans ZTR Crest with Sun Ringle Dirty Flea hubs. There is a small nick on the front rim - it does not affect the rim in any way. Please be aware that there is a weight limit on Stand Crest rims. If you push the scale towards triple digits you should perhaps look at getting a different wheelset. The Thompson seat post is 420mm. It does have some scuffing/marks on it from being inserted quite far into another frame set I was using it on. They may, or may not be visible depending on how far the post is inserted into the frame. Saddle is a Farr Go Farr jobbie.
