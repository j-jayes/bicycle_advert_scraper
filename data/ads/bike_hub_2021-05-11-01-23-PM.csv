I've ridden it a few times and rides really great, but I don't get to use it much these days, so it's just sitting around gathering dust, hence looking to move it on to a new home where it hopefully gets more usage and attention. Things to note: There are some paintwork issues as follows (see pictures): Seat tube - some chipped paintwork around the bottle cage bolts. When I got the frame, one of the bolts was stripped, so I had a local bike shop remove both seat tube bolts and replace them. They used 5mm bolts, which is different from Colnago standard (4mm), but you'd never notice. Unfortunately, some of the paintwork got chipped in the process. See pictures. Fork & seat stay: The left side has some chips when the wind blew the bike over when leaning against a stone wall. The stone chipped both the left fork blade and the left seat stay (see pictures) Drop outs: Some paint chipping here too. See pictures. Shifters: The left shifter is a little sticky on down shift (probably needs some Q20) If you want it to really look mint again, I'd recommend a full re-spray, but these issues are not significantly noticeable when the bike is build and being ridden. I guess it depends what you want to do with it. I can include a set of Campagnolo Hyperon Ultra (tubular) climbing wheels, with wheel bags and a BikeBoxAlan wheel box for an extra R5k if sold all as 1 package. See last pic.

I made quite a few upgrades over the comp model I had previously incl 12spd Shimano, RaceFace Turbine dropper (the E13 one was trash) and a few other bits. This specific model is the most recent geometry variant YT offers, it's basically a 2020/1 model with a 2018 paint jobbie. This is a 170mm front and rear GOAT that will winch you up the climbs just fine with it's respectable 76.0Â° STA. It's got a 460mm reach with a 703mm stand-over making it perfect for anyone in the height-range of 174cm - 184cm. On the descents the Capra will change the way you process trails, everything becomes a feature, you have more fun and the speed this bike generates is only ever matched by the confidence it instils the harder you push it.

Although the Scultura 400 is a great all-round road option, the Scultura frame platform is favoured by Team Lampre Merida in the UCI Pro Tour, meaning models throughout the series benefit from the research and technological innovation that goes into building a bike to perform at the highest level. A tapered head tube provides more strength and stiffness through the front end of the bike, which means improved overall handling. Flex Stay technology in the rear allows the frame to offer some vertical movement, which is designed to absorb bumps and vibrations to create a more comfortable ride.

This is a once off opportunity to get a Azub Mini recumbent at a price you can never beat. For a person 154 - 188 cm is a very comfortable fit as long as you weigh less than 125 Kg with the luggage! The recumbent is the ultimate long distance touring or commuter bike. Not many bikes come standard with this amount of carrier space that the Azub offers. With wind resistance less than 30% of the conventional bike and the most relaxed sitting position for your rear and back proves the fact that this is a bike that rides very easy. No need for special clothing. That is one of the reasons this bike is so popular in Europe to commute to work with. Easy riding low wind resistance. I imported this bike since I fractured my wrist many years ago and could no longer carry any weight on my one wrist. Since ordering and importing the bike I had an operation and can now ride our trusted tandem again, hence the reason I sell this bike. I have only ridden it about 200 Km since I got it, so it is almost brand new. This bike is available for immediate collection. No need to wait for the build, importing from Europe paying vat and import duties and clearing at customs and excise. This ia a major saving! Information about the Azub Mini: Stability of the Mini model is given by its long wheelbase. It is very compact and manoeuvrable thanks to its two 20"" wheels. Seat height, which is located lower than the bottom bracket, makes it an active bike with good power transmission. This becomes obvious in a rapid ride through the city as well as during a sportier ride around. If you do not have excessive demands, your Mini will carry you with no significant problems on gravel or forest roads Properties of Azub Mini: incredibly fast in accelerating perfect manoeuvrability both 20"" wheels super compact size stiff and durable aluminium frame List of components as per order from the manufacturers in Czech Republic: find the mini (20""Â wheels) AZUB Mini, orange, USS, DD27+tripple, White Brothers, Epicon, MT2, Ventisit AZUB MINI frame set Under steering AZUB (USS) 20"" Front suspension fork WHITE BROTHERS RC 80 1 1/8"" Head set AHEAD semi-integrated 28,6, cartridge H-146 Rear suspension SUNTOUR EPICON LOD (LockOut) 165mm Shifting set Dual Drive 27 PRO 20"" Shifter Dual Drive LEFT Shifter DualDrive 9-speed, trigger, right Brake set - disc.hydr. - MAGURA MT2 Front wheel 20"", Novatec DISK hub, Grand Hill rim Rear wheel 20"" Dual Drive 24/27, Grand Hill rim Pneu + tubes 20/20 1,5"" Schwalbe Marathon Seat pad Ventisit Comfort M (28x91) Carrier AZUB ALU MINI + Expedition carrier Stand ALU There are many many videos on YouTube on recumbents.

This frameset has done a total of 660km's according to my Strava stats. It was built as a Single Speed and has hardly been used in the last few years bar the odd commute. There are a few nicks on the frameset, noticeably on the head tube. SS World Champs 2012 number boards were steel plates and I fastened it to my brake hoses instead of my handlebars. Fork is a Salsa CroMoto Steel fork. The drivetrain has done a total of 50km's. (Shimano SLX 11-42, SRAM chain, SRAM Eagle 38T chain ring) I did a short ride just to make sure everything is in order. Juin Tech brakes are new (or 50km's from new). They are sealed Hydraulic units actuated via cable. Compared to my Avid BB-7's they are far superior. Don't expect full hydraulic brake performance though. I have not ridden full hydraulic brakes (SRAM Rival, Force) so I cannot really compare it to such brakes. With the 38T chain ring the chain line is not perfect - it is more biased towards the higher gears because of the 11-42 cassette. There is no issue shifting into the granny gear though. I have the direct mount spider which I will include in the sale. The SRAM Rival shifters are 2X11 and can thus be run in a 2X setup if you so wish. Wheelset is Stans ZTR Crest with Sun Ringle Dirty Flea hubs. There is a small nick on the front rim - it does not affect the rim in any way. Please be aware that there is a weight limit on Stand Crest rims. If you push the scale towards triple digits you should perhaps look at getting a different wheelset. The Thompson seat post is 420mm. It does have some scuffing/marks on it from being inserted quite far into another frame set I was using it on. They may, or may not be visible depending on how far the post is inserted into the frame. Saddle is a Farr Go Farr jobbie.
