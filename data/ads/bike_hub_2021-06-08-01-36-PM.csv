Climbed like a boss, very lightweight and nippy up. Chain jumped off once(not that it matters will be sold with narrow wide). The descend i burped the front wheel halfway down, but amazingly the chain didn't climb off. (I recon burp was due to setup as I am 184cm and it's a M Frame. So to the right length person it's irrelevant.) On the jumps I was more used to leaning a bit more forward but with this bike over jumpes it is very forgiving when making such mistakes and very rewarding when leaning back over anything. Front and back was very responsive to slides into corners and leans into burms. Breaks was affected on the way up(guessing has to do with the positioning of the break lever on the handlebar) but only the front, back was all round responsive. The shifting was a bit slow to my taste, but is running a old 9speed so understandable respectably. In my opinion, bike is really good for someone starting Cycling and wants to be spoiled with capability. Test was conducted with the flat pedals.

This frameset has done a total of 660km's according to my Strava stats. It was built as a Single Speed and has hardly been used in the last few years bar the odd commute. There are a few nicks on the frameset, noticeably on the head tube. SS World Champs 2012 number boards were steel plates and I fastened it to my brake hoses instead of my handlebars. Fork is a Salsa CroMoto Steel fork. The drivetrain has done a total of 50km's. (Shimano SLX 11-42, SRAM chain, SRAM Eagle 38T chain ring) I did a short ride just to make sure everything is in order. Juin Tech brakes are new (or 50km's from new). They are sealed Hydraulic units actuated via cable. Compared to my Avid BB-7's they are far superior. Don't expect full hydraulic brake performance though. I have not ridden full hydraulic brakes (SRAM Rival, Force) so I cannot really compare it to such brakes. With the 38T chain ring the chain line is not perfect - it is more biased towards the higher gears because of the 11-42 cassette. There is no issue shifting into the granny gear though. I have the direct mount spider which I will include in the sale. The SRAM Rival shifters are 2X11 and can thus be run in a 2X setup if you so wish. Wheelset is Stans ZTR Crest with Sun Ringle Dirty Flea hubs. There is a small nick on the front rim - it does not affect the rim in any way. Please be aware that there is a weight limit on Stand Crest rims. If you push the scale towards triple digits you should perhaps look at getting a different wheelset. The Thompson seat post is 420mm. It does have some scuffing/marks on it from being inserted quite far into another frame set I was using it on. They may, or may not be visible depending on how far the post is inserted into the frame. Saddle is a Farr Go Farr jobbie.

This was the first Tarmac, and, rumour has it, cost Specialized more to make than to sell. The frame is aluminium (bottom) and carbon (top) fused together to make one of the stiffest frames I have ever ridden on. This bike has history. Jamie Ball rode to third place in the Cape Town Cycle Tour (Argus) on it back in 2005, and I bought it from him. A friend has told me to keep it and put it up on the wall as he believes it's a museum-quality classic. I love just looking at it. It's a beauty of a thing. Robin Williams, the great comedian and actor, had one in his collection and it was sold at auction for a charity earlier this year. The frame has scratches and nicks, but is sound. The groupset has been upgraded to Dura Ace 7900 from the 7800 it came with. I'm selling it because I am simply not riding it, and it feels like a waste. It would be a great racing bike for a smaller person or for a collector. It weighs a shade over 7kg. The price is negotiable.

This brand new YT Capra CF frameset just arrived from Germany after falling victim to the Corona induced warranty process. Unable to wait any longer I pulled the trigger on a N+1 and here we are 6 months later, one fresh YT Capra CF model looking for a new home. I made quite a few upgrades over the comp model I had previously incl 12spd Shimano, RaceFace Turbine dropper (the E13 one was trash) and a few other bits. This specific model is the most recent geometry variant YT offers, it's basically a 2020/1 model with a 2018 paint jobbie. This is a 170mm front and rear GOAT that will winch you up the climbs just fine with it's respectable 76.0° STA. It's got a 460mm reach with a 703mm stand-over making it perfect for anyone in the height-range of 174cm - 184cm. On the descents the Capra will change the way you process trails, everything becomes a feature, you have more fun and the speed this bike generates is only ever matched by the confidence it instils the harder you push it.

First impressions, the power transfer from crank to rear wheel is instant and efficient. It accelerates well when you apply the power. 3 to 4 pedal strokes and it goes. Holding 35 to 40km speeds in a peloton seems effortless, you can go the whole day. Fitted with a complete 105 groupset that is smooth efficient and just seems to last forever. Almost 8000kms in just under 2 years and no signs of wear, it just goes. I do maintain my groupset very well and this is key. The wheels, Easton EA90 SLX, rolls for days, super light and still runs true even after a few pot holes. I had these setup with tubeless tires (with tubes in them) and they resist punctures like diamonds resists scratches. I don't have training wheels and these wheels just keeps rolling. Those who know me well, know that i ride with no tubes, spares or tools. I am that confident in these wheels regardless of the tires i fit on them. Keep it hard and tight I say. I currently run Bontrager Race Lites on these babies and they are some of the lightest race tires you can find. The ride, super efficient, light, quick off the start line, a climbing bike for sure. The 50-36 chainrings and 11 - 28 cassette allows for sustained climbing efforts. You will immediately hit PR's on the flats and climbs if you a weekend warrior and most likely see an immediate 2km average improvement on your normal rides. The handling is phenomenal, the bike always feel like it is there to support my every need and it really comes alive when you pushing watts out of the saddle, that's when you hit the proverbial beast mode button. The Scott CR range has achieved success since day one and has taken many legendary podiums along the way. I have to hand it to Scott, they have created an excellent well thought out frame that just works well. Needless to say, it is my pride and joy and i have looked well after this bike. It is near spotless and in pristine condition. I am letting this baby go to explore more of the Scott range.
