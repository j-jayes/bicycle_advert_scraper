First impressions, the power transfer from crank to rear wheel is instant and efficient. It accelerates well when you apply the power. 3 to 4 pedal strokes and it goes. Holding 35 to 40km speeds in a peloton seems effortless, you can go the whole day. Fitted with a complete 105 groupset that is smooth efficient and just seems to last forever. Almost 8000kms in just under 2 years and no signs of wear, it just goes. I do maintain my groupset very well and this is key. The wheels, Easton EA90 SLX, rolls for days, super light and still runs true even after a few pot holes. I had these setup with tubeless tires (with tubes in them) and they resist punctures like diamonds resists scratches. I don't have training wheels and these wheels just keeps rolling. Those who know me well, know that i ride with no tubes, spares or tools. I am that confident in these wheels regardless of the tires i fit on them. Keep it hard and tight I say. I currently run Bontrager Race Lites on these babies and they are some of the lightest race tires you can find. The ride, super efficient, light, quick off the start line, a climbing bike for sure. The 50-36 chainrings and 11 - 28 cassette allows for sustained climbing efforts. You will immediately hit PR's on the flats and climbs if you a weekend warrior and most likely see an immediate 2km average improvement on your normal rides. The handling is phenomenal, the bike always feel like it is there to support my every need and it really comes alive when you pushing watts out of the saddle, that's when you hit the proverbial beast mode button. The Scott CR range has achieved success since day one and has taken many legendary podiums along the way. I have to hand it to Scott, they have created an excellent well thought out frame that just works well. Needless to say, it is my pride and joy and i have looked well after this bike. It is near spotless and in pristine condition. I am letting this baby go to explore more of the Scott range.

It is a great option to get back into cycling or start your cycling journey if you don’t want to spend too much yet. Especially with the Cape Town Cycle Tour around the corner! Happy to throw in a good as new Selle Italia saddle that is not a good fit for me. It's a get on and go bike - I might just need to throw in some new rim brake pads if you don't have a set. Slightly negotiable on the price but looking for a buyer who understands the bike has value and will not come with ridiculous offers. I have spent below as assurance: Brand new bottom bracket (R800) Build up done to inspect parts + Full service done (R1650) 9 Speed Drive-train more than 50% life left in it. —— More about the bicycle: This limited-edition originally came out as a performance spec bicycle with Dura-Ace components. It is one of the few bicycle ranges from Schwinn that was still made in small factories producing some of the best frames in the US. Good to know since the public perception of the brand went downhill at that time when it was bought over by a mass wholesale brand. The bike was built up again as an alternative ride for some weekend trips where I didn’t want to use my racing bike. So only light riding is done on it. Hopefully, the photos communicate this clearly, but the bicycle has been well taken care of with top to bottom approval from Specialized that all is in good working order.Info box: Frame & Fork Aluminum Frame & Reynolds Carbon Fork Front Derailleur Shimano Tiagra Rear Derailleur Shimano 105 Shifters Shimano Tiagra Crankset Truvativ Brakes Shimano 105 Wheels Ritchey Tyres Continental Gatorskin 23mm Stem Alero Saddle Profile Design / Selle Italia Pedals None",10,"NA for bikehub",NA,"EanBarnard Message Seller Location Western Cape, Stellenbosch ","Western Cape, Stellenbosch ",NA,2,1,"2021-06-19 13:07:17","Western Cape","road bikes"

This frameset has done a total of 660km's according to my Strava stats. It was built as a Single Speed and has hardly been used in the last few years bar the odd commute. There are a few nicks on the frameset, noticeably on the head tube. SS World Champs 2012 number boards were steel plates and I fastened it to my brake hoses instead of my handlebars. Fork is a Salsa CroMoto Steel fork. The drivetrain has done a total of 50km's. (Shimano SLX 11-42, SRAM chain, SRAM Eagle 38T chain ring) I did a short ride just to make sure everything is in order. Juin Tech brakes are new (or 50km's from new). They are sealed Hydraulic units actuated via cable. Compared to my Avid BB-7's they are far superior. Don't expect full hydraulic brake performance though. I have not ridden full hydraulic brakes (SRAM Rival, Force) so I cannot really compare it to such brakes. With the 38T chain ring the chain line is not perfect - it is more biased towards the higher gears because of the 11-42 cassette. There is no issue shifting into the granny gear though. I have the direct mount spider which I will include in the sale. The SRAM Rival shifters are 2X11 and can thus be run in a 2X setup if you so wish. Wheelset is Stans ZTR Crest with Sun Ringle Dirty Flea hubs. There is a small nick on the front rim - it does not affect the rim in any way. Please be aware that there is a weight limit on Stand Crest rims. If you push the scale towards triple digits you should perhaps look at getting a different wheelset. The Thompson seat post is 420mm. It does have some scuffing/marks on it from being inserted quite far into another frame set I was using it on. They may, or may not be visible depending on how far the post is inserted into the frame. Saddle is a Farr Go Farr jobbie.
