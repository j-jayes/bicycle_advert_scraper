cave needs to be X=N-1    :-(My owner (heartless
&@#$!@#~) upgraded to a newer (younger) model despite me never giving him
any issues (me-thinks mid-life crisis = “It” has bigger ...... wheels than me
:-( and fewer gears).Currently I am on display in
the pain cave (up on a pedestal for him to feel guilty about not using me
anymore) but I need to go to a Good Home.I have been well looked after
and maintained regularly. I even got him into the race snakes batches (much to
his disgust/exhaustion). I have been treated to a half tubeless conversion (my
""rear""). The front tire is running a slime tube with an old tube as
an extra liner.Large frame (19"") in
“arctic” white and “rouge” red with some skimpy sexy black trim.I have two rear wheels - one
that is tubeless (and comes with a bottle of sealant) and the other that has a
""slick"" tyre (for attempted boredom on a dumb trainer - maybe 40km
use) and a Maxxis Highroller & Kenda small block 8 spare.Plus two more slime tubes as
spare and another normal tube.Before the tubeless conversion
my rear wheels were rotated more regularly to spread out the wear.I have Shimano spd pedals on
already but there is the option of brand new still in the box Ryder flat/spd
style pedals (with unused cleats) that can be put on instead.Hydraulic Disk Brakes = 180 mm
Front and 160 mm Rear.*Disclaimer - My Brakes work
the CORRECT way round according to the UK and if you ride a motorcycle. This
means Back Brake is on the left and Front Brake is on the Right... your LBS
(local bike shop) can switch the hoses around and re-bleed them.























*Owner's note: I love this bike
and hope it goes to a good home - the lure of the 1x12 and the 29er upgrade has
meant this bike ""has"" to go, although I still found it much more
controllable than the 29er - and I still keep searching for the higher and
lower gear ratios that this bike offers. Since moving to JHB in 2018 it has had
limited use and then none at all since winter last year.SilverBack Alpine 1

This bike is ideal for enduro racing and is also capable enough for most of our South African downhill races. I’m hoping to sell this bike to someone who will love it and ride it as hard as I have.

and Reserve 27’s Laced onto Chris King hubs wheelset.
Crank Brother Candy pedals are included.
