Currently I am on display in the pain cave (up on a pedestal for him to feel guilty about not using me anymore) but I need to go to a Good Home. I have been well looked after and maintained regularly. I even got him into the race snakes batches (much to his disgust/exhaustion). I have been treated to a half tubeless conversion (my ""rear""). The front tire is running a slime tube with an old tube as an extra liner. Large frame (19"") in “arctic” white and “rouge” red with some skimpy sexy black trim. I have TWO rear wheels - one that is tubeless (and comes with a bottle of sealant) and the other that currently has a ""slick"" tyre (for attempted boredom on a dumb trainer - maybe 40km use) and a Maxxis Highroller & Kenda small block 8 spare. Plus two more slime tubes as spare and another normal tube. Before the tubeless conversion my rear wheels were rotated more regularly to spread out the wear. I have Shimano spd pedals on already but there is the option of brand new still in the box Ryder flat/spd style pedals (with unused cleats) that can be put on instead. Hydraulic Disk Brakes = 180 mm Front and 160 mm Rear. *Disclaimer - My Brakes work the CORRECT way round according to the UK and if you ride a motorcycle. This means Back Brake is on the left and Front Brake is on the Right... your LBS (local bike shop) can switch the hoses around and re-bleed them. *Owner's note: I love this bike and hope it goes to a good home - the lure of the 1x12 and the 29er upgrade has meant this bike ""has"" to go, although I still found it much more controllable than the 29er - and I still keep searching for the higher and lower gear ratios that this bike offers.

I bought this frame last year and built it up as a ""downcountry"" bike basically as a higher spec 920-910 version. It's fantastic. Modern geo ensure confident handling, light weight and efficient suspension means it goes up, down and around with ease. Whether you want to do stage racing or just hammer around your local trails, it'll do it all. I rode the bike last year a lot during lock down. I clocked probably 1250-1500km on it. But after getting the frame and shock serviced at the end of 2020, I've ridden it maybe five times. So it's for sale due to lack of use. For the sale, it's been totally stripped and rebuilt with a lot of new parts: New chain so the drivetrain is gonna last and last. New brakes 100% pads, totally unused New carbon wheels (built with a used rear rim) New dropper New cockpit The full Fox suspension smooths out the trail and with the lockout you can hammer those sprints. The modern Shimano 12spd drivetrain is up to date and delivers superb performance with seamless shifts under power and doesn't drop chains. Everything is in mint condition and working well. With all the new parts, you have good peace of mind too. As shown in the pics, it is 12.6kg with a generous helping of Stan's If you want to drop the price, I can make a plan to sell it with alu wheels instead of carbon wheels. If you want to upgrade parts and save more weight, I have carbon cranks and Hixon integrated carbon bar which can be added to the sale.

This is a once off opportunity to get a Azub Mini recumbent at a price you can never beat. For a person 154 - 188 cm is a very comfortable fit as long as you weigh less than 125 Kg with the luggage! The recumbent is the ultimate long distance touring or commuter bike. Not many bikes come standard with this amount of carrier space that the Azub offers. With wind resistance less than 30% of the conventional bike and the most relaxed sitting position for your rear and back proves the fact that this is a bike that rides very easy. No need for special clothing. That is one of the reasons this bike is so popular in Europe to commute to work with. Easy riding low wind resistance. I imported this bike since I fractured my wrist many years ago and could no longer carry any weight on my one wrist. Since ordering and importing the bike I had an operation and can now ride our trusted tandem again, hence the reason I sell this bike. I have only ridden it about 200 Km since I got it, so it is almost brand new. This bike is available for immediate collection. No need to wait for the build, importing from Europe paying vat and import duties and clearing at customs and excise. This ia a major saving! Information about the Azub Mini: Stability of the Mini model is given by its long wheelbase. It is very compact and manoeuvrable thanks to its two 20"" wheels. Seat height, which is located lower than the bottom bracket, makes it an active bike with good power transmission. This becomes obvious in a rapid ride through the city as well as during a sportier ride around. If you do not have excessive demands, your Mini will carry you with no significant problems on gravel or forest roads Properties of Azub Mini: incredibly fast in accelerating perfect manoeuvrability both 20"" wheels super compact size stiff and durable aluminium frame List of components as per order from the manufacturers in Czech Republic: find the mini (20"" wheels) AZUB Mini, orange, USS, DD27+tripple, White Brothers, Epicon, MT2, Ventisit AZUB MINI frame set Under steering AZUB (USS) 20"" Front suspension fork WHITE BROTHERS RC 80 1 1/8"" Head set AHEAD semi-integrated 28,6, cartridge H-146 Rear suspension SUNTOUR EPICON LOD (LockOut) 165mm Shifting set Dual Drive 27 PRO 20"" Shifter Dual Drive LEFT Shifter DualDrive 9-speed, trigger, right Brake set - disc.hydr. - MAGURA MT2 Front wheel 20"", Novatec DISK hub, Grand Hill rim Rear wheel 20"" Dual Drive 24/27, Grand Hill rim Pneu + tubes 20/20 1,5"" Schwalbe Marathon Seat pad Ventisit Comfort M (28x91) Carrier AZUB ALU MINI + Expedition carrier Stand ALU There are many many videos on YouTube on recumbents.

I made quite a few upgrades over the comp model I had previously incl 12spd Shimano, RaceFace Turbine dropper (the E13 one was trash) and a few other bits. This specific model is the most recent geometry variant YT offers, it's basically a 2020/1 model with a 2018 paint jobbie. This is a 170mm front and rear GOAT that will winch you up the climbs just fine with it's respectable 76.0° STA. It's got a 460mm reach with a 703mm stand-over making it perfect for anyone in the height-range of 174cm - 184cm. On the descents the Capra will change the way you process trails, everything becomes a feature, you have more fun and the speed this bike generates is only ever matched by the confidence it instils the harder you push it.

This frameset has done a total of 660km's according to my Strava stats. It was built as a Single Speed and has hardly been used in the last few years bar the odd commute. There are a few nicks on the frameset, noticeably on the head tube. SS World Champs 2012 number boards were steel plates and I fastened it to my brake hoses instead of my handlebars. Fork is a Salsa CroMoto Steel fork. The drivetrain has done a total of 50km's. (Shimano SLX 11-42, SRAM chain, SRAM Eagle 38T chain ring) I did a short ride just to make sure everything is in order. Juin Tech brakes are new (or 50km's from new). They are sealed Hydraulic units actuated via cable. Compared to my Avid BB-7's they are far superior. Don't expect full hydraulic brake performance though. I have not ridden full hydraulic brakes (SRAM Rival, Force) so I cannot really compare it to such brakes. With the 38T chain ring the chain line is not perfect - it is more biased towards the higher gears because of the 11-42 cassette. There is no issue shifting into the granny gear though. I have the direct mount spider which I will include in the sale. The SRAM Rival shifters are 2X11 and can thus be run in a 2X setup if you so wish. Wheelset is Stans ZTR Crest with Sun Ringle Dirty Flea hubs. There is a small nick on the front rim - it does not affect the rim in any way. Please be aware that there is a weight limit on Stand Crest rims. If you push the scale towards triple digits you should perhaps look at getting a different wheelset. The Thompson seat post is 420mm. It does have some scuffing/marks on it from being inserted quite far into another frame set I was using it on. They may, or may not be visible depending on how far the post is inserted into the frame. Saddle is a Farr Go Farr jobbie.
