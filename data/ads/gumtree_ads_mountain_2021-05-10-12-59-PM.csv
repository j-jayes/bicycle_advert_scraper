FEATURES




Enduro Comp 29/6Fattie
The frame has an X-Wing layout with an M5 alloy construction. Together, these elements combine to form the perfect balance of efficiency, weight savings, and unparalleled strength. It's also been built off our 29 Geometry, which lends itself to running 6Fattie wheels and tires (only a 7mm BB drop), in order to provide an aggressive, well-rounded ride. And with internal routing and a return to a threaded bottom bracket, you get a bike that's clean, dependable, and ready for anything that the trail has to offer.
RockShox Yari RC fork features a 15x110mm Maxle Ultimate thru-axle, a Solo Air™ spring, and 160mm of plush travel to take on big hits and bumpy terrain with supreme speed and efficiency.
SRAM's 11-speed GX rear derailleur serves up powerful and precise one-by shifting, so you can say goodbye to dropped chains and unecessary grams.

I've owned it since new and always been serviced at Bells Specialised concept store in Nelspruit (and suspension sent to Cape Town).Just spent 6K on a major service including brand new tyres, new rear rim, bearings & brake pads.For piece of mind, if you're a serious buyer Bells cycling will take a call to give a rundown & verification of the bikes condition and also arrange shipping nationwide. No damage on frame, just the front of the seat a little damaged.

FEATURES




Enduro Comp 29/6Fattie
The frame has an X-Wing layout with an M5 alloy construction. Together, these elements combine to form the perfect balance of efficiency, weight savings, and unparalleled strength. It's also been built off our 29 Geometry, which lends itself to running 6Fattie wheels and tires (only a 7mm BB drop), in order to provide an aggressive, well-rounded ride. And with internal routing and a return to a threaded bottom bracket, you get a bike that's clean, dependable, and ready for anything that the trail has to offer.
RockShox Yari RC fork features a 15x110mm Maxle Ultimate thru-axle, a Solo Air™ spring, and 160mm of plush travel to take on big hits and bumpy terrain with supreme speed and efficiency.
SRAM's 11-speed GX rear derailleur serves up powerful and precise one-by shifting, so you can say goodbye to dropped chains and unecessary grams.

Weight

The most accurate way to determine any bike’s weight is to have your local dealer weigh it for you. Many brands strive to list the lowest possible weight, but in reality weight can vary based on size, finish, hardware and accessories. All our bikes are designed for best-in-class weight and ride quality.

The Öhlins RXF 36 fork was designed to be the gold standard in frontend suspension. It operates off of a three-chamber air spring design (two positive and one negative), and it utilizes proprietary TTX damping technology. Combined, this allows both parallel and separated oil flow that controls the overall pressure levels.
