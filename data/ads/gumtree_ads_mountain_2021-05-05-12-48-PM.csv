FEATURES




Enduro Comp 29/6Fattie
The frame has an X-Wing layout with an M5 alloy construction. Together, these elements combine to form the perfect balance of efficiency, weight savings, and unparalleled strength. It's also been built off our 29 Geometry, which lends itself to running 6Fattie wheels and tires (only a 7mm BB drop), in order to provide an aggressive, well-rounded ride. And with internal routing and a return to a threaded bottom bracket, you get a bike that's clean, dependable, and ready for anything that the trail has to offer.
RockShox Yari RC fork features a 15x110mm Maxle Ultimate thru-axle, a Solo Air™ spring, and 160mm of plush travel to take on big hits and bumpy terrain with supreme speed and efficiency.
SRAM's 11-speed GX rear derailleur serves up powerful and precise one-by shifting, so you can say goodbye to dropped chains and unecessary grams.

Perfect trail bike. Reason for selling : not using it. 
Bike hasn’t done 800km basically still brand new. 
Have a set of scott shoes number 10 (bought it for R5000) and a trail helmet (bought it for R4000) that i will add.

FEATURES




Enduro Comp 29/6Fattie
The frame has an X-Wing layout with an M5 alloy construction. Together, these elements combine to form the perfect balance of efficiency, weight savings, and unparalleled strength. It's also been built off our 29 Geometry, which lends itself to running 6Fattie wheels and tires (only a 7mm BB drop), in order to provide an aggressive, well-rounded ride. And with internal routing and a return to a threaded bottom bracket, you get a bike that's clean, dependable, and ready for anything that the trail has to offer.
RockShox Yari RC fork features a 15x110mm Maxle Ultimate thru-axle, a Solo Air™ spring, and 160mm of plush travel to take on big hits and bumpy terrain with supreme speed and efficiency.
SRAM's 11-speed GX rear derailleur serves up powerful and precise one-by shifting, so you can say goodbye to dropped chains and unecessary grams.

Weight

The most accurate way to determine any bike’s weight is to have your local dealer weigh it for you. Many brands strive to list the lowest possible weight, but in reality weight can vary based on size, finish, hardware and accessories. All our bikes are designed for best-in-class weight and ride quality.

The Öhlins RXF 36 fork was designed to be the gold standard in frontend suspension. It operates off of a three-chamber air spring design (two positive and one negative), and it utilizes proprietary TTX damping technology. Combined, this allows both parallel and separated oil flow that controls the overall pressure levels. 
Roval Traverse SL 29 carbon wheels are the ultimate in lightweight rolling stock for the trail. They're built to take a hit, and they feature a wide rim width that boosts handling and stability over any kind of terrain.

cave needs to be X=N-1    :-(My owner (heartless
&@#$!@#~) upgraded to a newer (younger) model despite me never giving him
any issues (me-thinks mid-life crisis = “It” has bigger ...... wheels than me
:-( and fewer gears).Currently I am on display in
the pain cave (up on a pedestal for him to feel guilty about not using me
anymore) but I need to go to a Good Home.I have been well looked after
and maintained regularly. I even got him into the race snakes batches (much to
his disgust/exhaustion). I have been treated to a half tubeless conversion (my
""rear""). The front tire is running a slime tube with an old tube as
an extra liner.Large frame (19"") in
“arctic” white and “rouge” red with some skimpy sexy black trim.I have two rear wheels - one
that is tubeless (and comes with a bottle of sealant) and the other that has a
""slick"" tyre (for attempted boredom on a dumb trainer - maybe 40km
use) and a Maxxis Highroller & Kenda small block 8 spare.Plus two more slime tubes as
spare and another normal tube.Before the tubeless conversion
my rear wheels were rotated more regularly to spread out the wear.I have Shimano spd pedals on
already but there is the option of brand new still in the box Ryder flat/spd
style pedals (with unused cleats) that can be put on instead.Hydraulic Disk Brakes = 180 mm
Front and 160 mm Rear.*Disclaimer - My Brakes work
the CORRECT way round according to the UK and if you ride a motorcycle. This
means Back Brake is on the left and Front Brake is on the Right... your LBS
(local bike shop) can switch the hoses around and re-bleed them.























*Owner's note: I love this bike
and hope it goes to a good home - the lure of the 1x12 and the 29er upgrade has
meant this bike ""has"" to go, although I still found it much more
controllable than the 29er - and I still keep searching for the higher and
lower gear ratios that this bike offers. Since moving to JHB in 2018 it has had
limited use and then none at all since winter last year.SilverBack Alpine 1

The bearings will spin smoothly for over a decade for most users and they are nearly indestructible. Seals are very good and keep the dirt and water out. They are reasonable weight and the solid design can outlast most bikes.

Fitted with a 2l petrol tank capable of delivering an estimated range of 90km’s.

The bicycle, with its small engine capacity, still qualifies as a bicycle, which means no licensing or roadworthy certificate are required.

The bicycle is able to effectively operate with a person weighing up to 115kg and is estimated to reach 40km/h.

This is a cost effective innovation which I believe will be perfect for visual patrolling and rapid/easy response just about anywhere, requiring very little maintenance.

The engine is fitted with a magneto, which can be utilized to power up lights if necessary.

We can supply complete bicycles to suit your needs or modify your current bicycle to your specifications.

These bicycles are extremely easy to use and operates with a clutch system similar to that of a motorcycle.

Replacement parts are readily available.

Fitted with a 2l petrol tank capable of delivering an estimated range of 90km’s.

The bicycle, with its small engine capacity, still qualifies as a bicycle, which means no licensing or roadworthy certificate are required.

The bicycle is able to effectively operate with a person weighing up to 115kg and is estimated to reach 40km/h.

This is a cost effective innovation which I believe will be perfect for visual patrolling and rapid/easy response just about anywhere, requiring very little maintenance.

The engine is fitted with a magneto, which can be utilized to power up lights if necessary.
