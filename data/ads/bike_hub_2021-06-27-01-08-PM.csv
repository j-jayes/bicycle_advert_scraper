It is a great option to get back into cycling or start your cycling journey if you don’t want to spend too much yet. Especially with the Cape Town Cycle Tour around the corner! Happy to throw in a good as new Selle Italia saddle that is not a good fit for me. It's a get on and go bike - I might just need to throw in some new rim brake pads if you don't have a set. Slightly negotiable on the price but looking for a buyer who understands the bike has value and will not come with ridiculous offers. I have spent below as assurance: Brand new bottom bracket (R800) Build up done to inspect parts + Full service done (R1650) 9 Speed Drive-train more than 50% life left in it. —— More about the bicycle: This limited-edition originally came out as a performance spec bicycle with Dura-Ace components. It is one of the few bicycle ranges from Schwinn that was still made in small factories producing some of the best frames in the US. Good to know since the public perception of the brand went downhill at that time when it was bought over by a mass wholesale brand. The bike was built up again as an alternative ride for some weekend trips where I didn’t want to use my racing bike. So only light riding is done on it. Hopefully, the photos communicate this clearly, but the bicycle has been well taken care of with top to bottom approval from Specialized that all is in good working order.Info box: Frame & Fork Aluminum Frame & Reynolds Carbon Fork Front Derailleur Shimano Tiagra Rear Derailleur Shimano 105 Shifters Shimano Tiagra Crankset Truvativ Brakes Shimano 105 Wheels Ritchey Tyres Continental Gatorskin 23mm Stem Alero Saddle Profile Design / Selle Italia Pedals None",10,"NA for bikehub",NA,"EanBarnard Message Seller Location Western Cape, Stellenbosch ","Western Cape, Stellenbosch ",NA,2,1,"2021-06-27 12:26:58","Western Cape","road bikes"

It is a great option to get back into cycling or start your cycling journey if you don’t want to spend too much yet. Especially with the Cape Town Cycle Tour around the corner! Happy to throw in a good as new Selle Italia saddle that is not a good fit for me. It's a get on and go bike - I might just need to throw in some new rim brake pads if you don't have a set. Slightly negotiable on the price but looking for a buyer who understands the bike has value and will not come with ridiculous offers. I have spent below as assurance: Brand new bottom bracket (R800) Build up done to inspect parts + Full service done (R1650) 9 Speed Drive-train more than 50% life left in it. —— More about the bicycle: This limited-edition originally came out as a performance spec bicycle with Dura-Ace components. It is one of the few bicycle ranges from Schwinn that was still made in small factories producing some of the best frames in the US. Good to know since the public perception of the brand went downhill at that time when it was bought over by a mass wholesale brand. The bike was built up again as an alternative ride for some weekend trips where I didn’t want to use my racing bike. So only light riding is done on it. Hopefully, the photos communicate this clearly, but the bicycle has been well taken care of with top to bottom approval from Specialized that all is in good working order.Info box: Frame & Fork Aluminum Frame & Reynolds Carbon Fork Front Derailleur Shimano Tiagra Rear Derailleur Shimano 105 Shifters Shimano Tiagra Crankset Truvativ Brakes Shimano 105 Wheels Ritchey Tyres Continental Gatorskin 23mm Stem Alero Saddle Profile Design / Selle Italia Pedals None",10,"NA for bikehub",NA,"EanBarnard Message Seller Location Western Cape, Stellenbosch ","Western Cape, Stellenbosch ",NA,2,1,"2021-06-27 12:27:33","Western Cape","road bikes"

It is a great option to get back into cycling or start your cycling journey if you don’t want to spend too much yet. Especially with the Cape Town Cycle Tour around the corner! Happy to throw in a good as new Selle Italia saddle that is not a good fit for me. It's a get on and go bike - I might just need to throw in some new rim brake pads if you don't have a set.

I have spent below as assurance: Brand new bottom bracket (R800) Build up done to inspect parts + Full service done (R1650) 9 Speed Drive-train more than 50% life left in it. —— More about the bicycle: This limited-edition originally came out as a performance spec bicycle with Dura-Ace components. It is one of the few bicycle ranges from Schwinn that was still made in small factories producing some of the best frames in the US. Good to know since the public perception of the brand went downhill at that time when it was bought over by a mass wholesale brand. The bike was built up again as an alternative ride for some weekend trips where I didn’t want to use my racing bike. So only light riding is done on it. Hopefully, the photos communicate this clearly, but the bicycle has been well taken care of with top to bottom approval from Specialized that all is in good working order.Info box: Frame & Fork Aluminum Frame & Reynolds Carbon Fork Front Derailleur Shimano Tiagra Rear Derailleur Shimano 105 Shifters Shimano Tiagra Crankset Truvativ Brakes Shimano 105 Wheels Ritchey Tyres Continental Gatorskin 23mm Stem Alero Saddle Profile Design / Selle Italia Pedals None",10,"NA for bikehub",NA,"EanBarnard Message Seller Location Western Cape, Stellenbosch ","Western Cape, Stellenbosch ",NA,2,1,"2021-06-27 12:29:54","Western Cape","road bikes"

It is a great option to get back into cycling or start your cycling journey if you don’t want to spend too much yet. Especially with the Cape Town Cycle Tour around the corner! Happy to throw in a good as new Selle Italia saddle that is not a good fit for me. It's a get on and go bike - I might just need to throw in some new rim brake pads if you don't have a set. Slightly negotiable on the price but looking for a buyer who understands the bike has value and will not come with ridiculous offers. I have spent below as assurance: Brand new bottom bracket (R800) Build up done to inspect parts + Full service done (R1650) 9 Speed Drive-train more than 50% life left in it. —— More about the bicycle: This limited-edition originally came out as a performance spec bicycle with Dura-Ace components. It is one of the few bicycle ranges from Schwinn that was still made in small factories producing some of the best frames in the US. Good to know since the public perception of the brand went downhill at that time when it was bought over by a mass wholesale brand. The bike was built up again as an alternative ride for some weekend trips where I didn’t want to use my racing bike. So only light riding is done on it. Hopefully, the photos communicate this clearly, but the bicycle has been well taken care of with top to bottom approval from Specialized that all is in good working order.Info box: Frame & Fork Aluminum Frame & Reynolds Carbon Fork Front Derailleur Shimano Tiagra Rear Derailleur Shimano 105 Shifters Shimano Tiagra Crankset Truvativ Brakes Shimano 105 Wheels Ritchey Tyres Continental Gatorskin 23mm Stem Alero Saddle Profile Design / Selle Italia Pedals None",10,"NA for bikehub",NA,"EanBarnard Message Seller Location Western Cape, Stellenbosch ","Western Cape, Stellenbosch ",NA,2,1,"2021-06-27 12:31:03","Western Cape","road bikes"

It is a great option to get back into cycling or start your cycling journey if you don’t want to spend too much yet. Especially with the Cape Town Cycle Tour around the corner!

I have spent below as assurance: Brand new bottom bracket (R800) Build up done to inspect parts + Full service done (R1650) 9 Speed Drive-train more than 50% life left in it. —— More about the bicycle: This limited-edition originally came out as a performance spec bicycle with Dura-Ace components. It is one of the few bicycle ranges from Schwinn that was still made in small factories producing some of the best frames in the US. Good to know since the public perception of the brand went downhill at that time when it was bought over by a mass wholesale brand. The bike was built up again as an alternative ride for some weekend trips where I didn’t want to use my racing bike. So only light riding is done on it. Hopefully, the photos communicate this clearly, but the bicycle has been well taken care of with top to bottom approval from Specialized that all is in good working order.Info box: Frame & Fork Aluminum Frame & Reynolds Carbon Fork Front Derailleur Shimano Tiagra Rear Derailleur Shimano 105 Shifters Shimano Tiagra Crankset Truvativ Brakes Shimano 105 Wheels Ritchey Tyres Continental Gatorskin 23mm Stem Alero Saddle Profile Design / Selle Italia Pedals None",10,"NA for bikehub",NA,"EanBarnard Message Seller Location Western Cape, Stellenbosch ","Western Cape, Stellenbosch ",NA,2,1,"2021-06-27 12:33:17","Western Cape","road bikes"

I'm sure you could find a cheaper option, I just don't have time at the moment. *don't go too cheap though! this bike deserves to be looked after ;) Valued at R9000 new here: https://www.bikepedia.com/QuickBike/BikeSpecs.aspx?item=35693Info box: Frame & Fork Trek 1000 Alpha Series Front Derailleur Shimano Sora Rear Derailleur Shimano Sora Chain KMC Z-series Saddle I have a spare comfy Gel saddle if you would like that instead of the stock one shown in the pics",7,"NA for bikehub",NA,"Nic Reid Message Seller Phone Number Buy with Bike Hub Pay Buy safely with Bike Hub Pay Your payment is held securely until you receive the goods.

Hyper Metallic Grey - BOOST Some of you regulars to the forums will know this as i was literally posting it everytime I got a chance. Such a versatile bike, can be set up for anything from adventure cycling to a trail shredder. See the pics for some of its many faces. I currently use it as a converted SS bike. This is the ONLY Valhallen in SA. Even it's name is metal AF isn't it?. \m/ \m/ It has given me plenty of happy km's, has even been bikejacked once, so it gave them some joy for 3 weeks too. I paid people to track it down and buy it back (and other things) from the skollies...thats how much I love this bike. You will too. Don't fret though...it is in pristine condition still as you can see. My priorities have changed and it's time to move on. Frame takes anything from 27.5 x 3.2"" to 29 x 2.6"" tires. Rigid to 140mm forks. Internally routed for a dropper post. See images for geometry. - Soma is a small boutique frame brand from San Fransico, California. They specialise in what they call ""everyday bikes"". This is one of those bikes. For what it's worth...my new project is a Soma too. - Tange Prestige Steel Hardtail with light trail geometry. If you dont know what Tange steel is...It's the Japanese equivalent to Reynolds, Columbus et al. - Carver Trail 490 UD Carbon Boost fork. This is marketed as a rigid trail fork. Burly. - Hope headset and Seatpost collar - Praxis Conversion BB PF30 to Shimano. - Raceface Turbine Seatpost and Stem - SQ Labs 30X 16* handlebars (brand new) with SQlabs 711 grips. - Shimano M6000 brakeset - Shimano SLX m7100 cranks (brand new) - HOPE Pro4 BOOST hubs (silver) laced to brand new Rapide TR29 - SL36 rims - 36mm ID with Wheelsmith spokes. - Shimano Icetech rotors, 180mm front/ 160mm rear. - Brand new Maxxis Rekon 29x2.6 front tire, used Rekon Race 2.35 rear. (ill include an extra Rekon race rear) - Wolftooth Stainless Steel 19T SS cog in the rear. - Brooks C15 Saddle OR tan tan C17 (you can pick). If you are going to toss it in a drawer rather tell me and ill give you something else like a Selle italia or something. Asking R18000. if you would like to haggle - i'll meet you at the table with older bars, saddle, tires etc. If you just want the frame...tell me. I don't HAVE to sell it. it might just be used less or get built onto one my wife's bike. She Will have the best 'hand me down' that ever existed for wives. No silly offers please. The price is already silly. I have the invoices to prove that this is way less than 50% of what this will cost you to put together yourself...not to mention what I paid to get it back after it was stolen haha. So please...accept a good deal when you see one. Build your dream adventure mtb or a lekker steel hardcore hardtail with 140mm of squish...or choose to improve (read torture) yourself in its current guise. As is it weighs around 12kg. I'll consider breaking it up if there is interest...but you know you'll pay more for the parts rather than the whole. But we can chat. Contact Morné - WhatsApp and PM only. I'll get back to you asap. - Prefer local Sale...so not to sure about shipping it anywhere, if you want me to box it i'll invoice you for my time and then it will cost you a lot more anyway. - I think we'll try out this Bikehub Pay thing too, unless you are willing to make an immediate EFT before collection.

This was the first Tarmac, and, rumour has it, cost Specialized more to make than to sell. The frame is aluminium (bottom) and carbon (top) fused together to make one of the stiffest frames I have ever ridden on. This bike has history. Jamie Ball rode to third place in the Cape Town Cycle Tour (Argus) on it back in 2005, and I bought it from him. A friend has told me to keep it and put it up on the wall as he believes it's a museum-quality classic. I love just looking at it. It's a beauty of a thing. Robin Williams, the great comedian and actor, had one in his collection and it was sold at auction for a charity earlier this year. The frame has scratches and nicks, but is sound. The groupset has been upgraded to Dura Ace 7900 from the 7800 it came with. I'm selling it because I am simply not riding it, and it feels like a waste. It would be a great racing bike for a smaller person or for a collector. It weighs a shade over 7kg. The price is negotiable.

It is a great option to get back into cycling or start your cycling journey if you don’t want to spend too much yet. Especially with the Cape Town Cycle Tour around the corner!

I have spent below as assurance: Brand new bottom bracket (R800) Build up done to inspect parts + Full service done (R1650) 9 Speed Drive-train more than 50% life left in it. —— More about the bicycle: This limited-edition originally came out as a performance spec bicycle with Dura-Ace components. It is one of the few bicycle ranges from Schwinn that was still made in small factories producing some of the best frames in the US. Good to know since the public perception of the brand went downhill at that time when it was bought over by a mass wholesale brand. The bike was built up again as an alternative ride for some weekend trips where I didn’t want to use my racing bike. So only light riding is done on it. Hopefully, the photos communicate this clearly, but the bicycle has been well taken care of with top to bottom approval from Specialized that all is in good working order.Info box: Frame & Fork Aluminum Frame & Reynolds Carbon Fork Front Derailleur Shimano Tiagra Rear Derailleur Shimano 105 Shifters Shimano Tiagra Crankset Truvativ Brakes Shimano 105 Wheels Ritchey Tyres Continental Gatorskin 23mm Stem Alero Saddle Profile Design / Selle Italia Pedals None",10,"NA for bikehub",NA,"EanBarnard Message Seller Location Western Cape, Stellenbosch ","Western Cape, Stellenbosch ",NA,2,1,"2021-06-27 12:39:01","Western Cape","road bikes"

It is one of the few bicycle ranges from Schwinn that was still made in small factories producing some of the best frames in the US. Good to know since the public perception of the brand went downhill at that time when it was bought over by a mass wholesale brand. The bike was built up again as an alternative ride for some weekend trips where I didn’t want to use my racing bike. So only light riding is done on it. Hopefully, the photos communicate this clearly, but the bicycle has been well taken care of with top to bottom approval from Specialized that all is in good working order.Info box: Frame & Fork Aluminum Frame & Reynolds Carbon Fork Front Derailleur Shimano Tiagra Rear Derailleur Shimano 105 Shifters Shimano Tiagra Crankset Truvativ Brakes Shimano 105 Wheels Ritchey Tyres Continental Gatorskin 23mm Stem Alero Saddle Profile Design / Selle Italia Pedals None",10,"NA for bikehub",NA,"EanBarnard Message Seller Location Western Cape, Stellenbosch ","Western Cape, Stellenbosch ",NA,2,1,"2021-06-27 12:49:31","Western Cape","road bikes"

It is a great option to get back into cycling or start your cycling journey if you don’t want to spend too much yet. Especially with the Cape Town Cycle Tour around the corner! Happy to throw in a good as new Selle Italia saddle that is not a good fit for me. It's a get on and go bike - I might just need to throw in some new rim brake pads if you don't have a set. Slightly negotiable on the price but looking for a buyer who understands the bike has value and will not come with ridiculous offers. I have spent below as assurance: Brand new bottom bracket (R800) Build up done to inspect parts + Full service done (R1650) 9 Speed Drive-train more than 50% life left in it. —— More about the bicycle: This limited-edition originally came out as a performance spec bicycle with Dura-Ace components. It is one of the few bicycle ranges from Schwinn that was still made in small factories producing some of the best frames in the US. Good to know since the public perception of the brand went downhill at that time when it was bought over by a mass wholesale brand. The bike was built up again as an alternative ride for some weekend trips where I didn’t want to use my racing bike. So only light riding is done on it. Hopefully, the photos communicate this clearly, but the bicycle has been well taken care of with top to bottom approval from Specialized that all is in good working order.Info box: Frame & Fork Aluminum Frame & Reynolds Carbon Fork Front Derailleur Shimano Tiagra Rear Derailleur Shimano 105 Shifters Shimano Tiagra Crankset Truvativ Brakes Shimano 105 Wheels Ritchey Tyres Continental Gatorskin 23mm Stem Alero Saddle Profile Design / Selle Italia Pedals None",10,"NA for bikehub",NA,"EanBarnard Message Seller Location Western Cape, Stellenbosch ","Western Cape, Stellenbosch ",NA,2,1,"2021-06-27 12:50:39","Western Cape","road bikes"

First impressions, the power transfer from crank to rear wheel is instant and efficient. It accelerates well when you apply the power. 3 to 4 pedal strokes and it goes. Holding 35 to 40km speeds in a peloton seems effortless, you can go the whole day. Fitted with a complete 105 groupset that is smooth efficient and just seems to last forever. Almost 8000kms in just under 2 years and no signs of wear, it just goes. I do maintain my groupset very well and this is key. The wheels, Easton EA90 SLX, rolls for days, super light and still runs true even after a few pot holes. I had these setup with tubeless tires (with tubes in them) and they resist punctures like diamonds resists scratches. I don't have training wheels and these wheels just keeps rolling. Those who know me well, know that i ride with no tubes, spares or tools. I am that confident in these wheels regardless of the tires i fit on them. Keep it hard and tight I say. I currently run Bontrager Race Lites on these babies and they are some of the lightest race tires you can find. The ride, super efficient, light, quick off the start line, a climbing bike for sure. The 50-36 chainrings and 11 - 28 cassette allows for sustained climbing efforts. You will immediately hit PR's on the flats and climbs if you a weekend warrior and most likely see an immediate 2km average improvement on your normal rides. The handling is phenomenal, the bike always feel like it is there to support my every need and it really comes alive when you pushing watts out of the saddle, that's when you hit the proverbial beast mode button. The Scott CR range has achieved success since day one and has taken many legendary podiums along the way. I have to hand it to Scott, they have created an excellent well thought out frame that just works well. Needless to say, it is my pride and joy and i have looked well after this bike. It is near spotless and in pristine condition. I am letting this baby go to explore more of the Scott range.

It is a great option to get back into cycling or start your cycling journey if you don’t want to spend too much yet. Especially with the Cape Town Cycle Tour around the corner! Happy to throw in a good as new Selle Italia saddle that is not a good fit for me. It's a get on and go bike - I might just need to throw in some new rim brake pads if you don't have a set. Slightly negotiable on the price but looking for a buyer who understands the bike has value and will not come with ridiculous offers. I have spent below as assurance: Brand new bottom bracket (R800) Build up done to inspect parts + Full service done (R1650) 9 Speed Drive-train more than 50% life left in it. —— More about the bicycle: This limited-edition originally came out as a performance spec bicycle with Dura-Ace components. It is one of the few bicycle ranges from Schwinn that was still made in small factories producing some of the best frames in the US. Good to know since the public perception of the brand went downhill at that time when it was bought over by a mass wholesale brand. The bike was built up again as an alternative ride for some weekend trips where I didn’t want to use my racing bike. So only light riding is done on it. Hopefully, the photos communicate this clearly, but the bicycle has been well taken care of with top to bottom approval from Specialized that all is in good working order.Info box: Frame & Fork Aluminum Frame & Reynolds Carbon Fork Front Derailleur Shimano Tiagra Rear Derailleur Shimano 105 Shifters Shimano Tiagra Crankset Truvativ Brakes Shimano 105 Wheels Ritchey Tyres Continental Gatorskin 23mm Stem Alero Saddle Profile Design / Selle Italia Pedals None",10,"NA for bikehub",NA,"EanBarnard Message Seller Location Western Cape, Stellenbosch ","Western Cape, Stellenbosch ",NA,2,1,"2021-06-27 12:51:22","Western Cape","road bikes"

It is a great option to get back into cycling or start your cycling journey if you don’t want to spend too much yet. Especially with the Cape Town Cycle Tour around the corner!

I have spent below as assurance: Brand new bottom bracket (R800) Build up done to inspect parts + Full service done (R1650) 9 Speed Drive-train more than 50% life left in it. —— More about the bicycle: This limited-edition originally came out as a performance spec bicycle with Dura-Ace components. It is one of the few bicycle ranges from Schwinn that was still made in small factories producing some of the best frames in the US. Good to know since the public perception of the brand went downhill at that time when it was bought over by a mass wholesale brand. The bike was built up again as an alternative ride for some weekend trips where I didn’t want to use my racing bike. So only light riding is done on it. Hopefully, the photos communicate this clearly, but the bicycle has been well taken care of with top to bottom approval from Specialized that all is in good working order.Info box: Frame & Fork Aluminum Frame & Reynolds Carbon Fork Front Derailleur Shimano Tiagra Rear Derailleur Shimano 105 Shifters Shimano Tiagra Crankset Truvativ Brakes Shimano 105 Wheels Ritchey Tyres Continental Gatorskin 23mm Stem Alero Saddle Profile Design / Selle Italia Pedals None",10,"NA for bikehub",NA,"EanBarnard Message Seller Location Western Cape, Stellenbosch ","Western Cape, Stellenbosch ",NA,2,1,"2021-06-27 12:52:20","Western Cape","road bikes"

It is a great option to get back into cycling or start your cycling journey if you don’t want to spend too much yet. Especially with the Cape Town Cycle Tour around the corner! Happy to throw in a good as new Selle Italia saddle that is not a good fit for me. It's a get on and go bike - I might just need to throw in some new rim brake pads if you don't have a set. Slightly negotiable on the price but looking for a buyer who understands the bike has value and will not come with ridiculous offers. I have spent below as assurance: Brand new bottom bracket (R800) Build up done to inspect parts + Full service done (R1650) 9 Speed Drive-train more than 50% life left in it. —— More about the bicycle: This limited-edition originally came out as a performance spec bicycle with Dura-Ace components. It is one of the few bicycle ranges from Schwinn that was still made in small factories producing some of the best frames in the US. Good to know since the public perception of the brand went downhill at that time when it was bought over by a mass wholesale brand. The bike was built up again as an alternative ride for some weekend trips where I didn’t want to use my racing bike. So only light riding is done on it. Hopefully, the photos communicate this clearly, but the bicycle has been well taken care of with top to bottom approval from Specialized that all is in good working order.Info box: Frame & Fork Aluminum Frame & Reynolds Carbon Fork Front Derailleur Shimano Tiagra Rear Derailleur Shimano 105 Shifters Shimano Tiagra Crankset Truvativ Brakes Shimano 105 Wheels Ritchey Tyres Continental Gatorskin 23mm Stem Alero Saddle Profile Design / Selle Italia Pedals None",10,"NA for bikehub",NA,"EanBarnard Message Seller Location Western Cape, Stellenbosch ","Western Cape, Stellenbosch ",NA,2,1,"2021-06-27 12:55:48","Western Cape","road bikes"

It is a great option to get back into cycling or start your cycling journey if you don’t want to spend too much yet. Especially with the Cape Town Cycle Tour around the corner!

I have spent below as assurance: Brand new bottom bracket (R800) Build up done to inspect parts + Full service done (R1650) 9 Speed Drive-train more than 50% life left in it. —— More about the bicycle: This limited-edition originally came out as a performance spec bicycle with Dura-Ace components. It is one of the few bicycle ranges from Schwinn that was still made in small factories producing some of the best frames in the US. Good to know since the public perception of the brand went downhill at that time when it was bought over by a mass wholesale brand. The bike was built up again as an alternative ride for some weekend trips where I didn’t want to use my racing bike. So only light riding is done on it.

It is a great option to get back into cycling or start your cycling journey if you don’t want to spend too much yet. Especially with the Cape Town Cycle Tour around the corner! Happy to throw in a good as new Selle Italia saddle that is not a good fit for me. It's a get on and go bike - I might just need to throw in some new rim brake pads if you don't have a set. Slightly negotiable on the price but looking for a buyer who understands the bike has value and will not come with ridiculous offers. I have spent below as assurance: Brand new bottom bracket (R800) Build up done to inspect parts + Full service done (R1650) 9 Speed Drive-train more than 50% life left in it. —— More about the bicycle: This limited-edition originally came out as a performance spec bicycle with Dura-Ace components. It is one of the few bicycle ranges from Schwinn that was still made in small factories producing some of the best frames in the US. Good to know since the public perception of the brand went downhill at that time when it was bought over by a mass wholesale brand. The bike was built up again as an alternative ride for some weekend trips where I didn’t want to use my racing bike. So only light riding is done on it. Hopefully, the photos communicate this clearly, but the bicycle has been well taken care of with top to bottom approval from Specialized that all is in good working order.Info box: Frame & Fork Aluminum Frame & Reynolds Carbon Fork Front Derailleur Shimano Tiagra Rear Derailleur Shimano 105 Shifters Shimano Tiagra Crankset Truvativ Brakes Shimano 105 Wheels Ritchey Tyres Continental Gatorskin 23mm Stem Alero Saddle Profile Design / Selle Italia Pedals None",10,"NA for bikehub",NA,"EanBarnard Message Seller Location Western Cape, Stellenbosch ","Western Cape, Stellenbosch ",NA,2,1,"2021-06-27 13:02:47","Western Cape","road bikes"

It is a great option to get back into cycling or start your cycling journey if you don’t want to spend too much yet. Especially with the Cape Town Cycle Tour around the corner! Happy to throw in a good as new Selle Italia saddle that is not a good fit for me. It's a get on and go bike - I might just need to throw in some new rim brake pads if you don't have a set. Slightly negotiable on the price but looking for a buyer who understands the bike has value and will not come with ridiculous offers. I have spent below as assurance: Brand new bottom bracket (R800) Build up done to inspect parts + Full service done (R1650) 9 Speed Drive-train more than 50% life left in it. —— More about the bicycle: This limited-edition originally came out as a performance spec bicycle with Dura-Ace components. It is one of the few bicycle ranges from Schwinn that was still made in small factories producing some of the best frames in the US. Good to know since the public perception of the brand went downhill at that time when it was bought over by a mass wholesale brand. The bike was built up again as an alternative ride for some weekend trips where I didn’t want to use my racing bike. So only light riding is done on it. Hopefully, the photos communicate this clearly, but the bicycle has been well taken care of with top to bottom approval from Specialized that all is in good working order.Info box: Frame & Fork Aluminum Frame & Reynolds Carbon Fork Front Derailleur Shimano Tiagra Rear Derailleur Shimano 105 Shifters Shimano Tiagra Crankset Truvativ Brakes Shimano 105 Wheels Ritchey Tyres Continental Gatorskin 23mm Stem Alero Saddle Profile Design / Selle Italia Pedals None",10,"NA for bikehub",NA,"EanBarnard Message Seller Location Western Cape, Stellenbosch ","Western Cape, Stellenbosch ",NA,2,1,"2021-06-27 13:05:41","Western Cape","road bikes"
